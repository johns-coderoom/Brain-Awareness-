## 📖 Project Overview

This portfolio details the organization, execution, and outcomes of the **"Do you know your brain?"** conference, held during Brain Awareness Week. The project transformed a standard school environment into a dynamic hub of scientific inquiry, directly engaging over 770 students, teachers, and family members.

The conference was modelled on a real academic conference, featuring keynotes from international experts, student presentations, hands-on workshops, a 3D model gallery, and a poster session. Its primary goal was to expand knowledge of the human brain and foster a lifelong passion for science in a diverse, age-appropriate manner.

## 🎯 Key Features & Deliverables

*   **In- person Conference Model:** Successfully combined in-person workshops and online expert lectures.
*   **Multi-Age Curriculum:** Designed and delivered tailored content for audiences from nursery (age 3) to high school (age 18+).
*   **Student-Led Competitions:** Hosted two main competitions:
    *   **3D Model Creation:** Building a brain or neuron from various materials.
    *   **Scientific Presentation:** Preparing and delivering a neuroscience topic to a younger audience.
*   **Interactive "Gallery Walk":** A dedicated space showcasing all student competition entries.
*   **Poster Session:** A formal session where students presented their research posters to peers.
*   **Community Engagement:** Extended learning beyond the classroom by involving hundreds of family members through online lectures.

## 👥 Target Audience & DEI

The project was designed for the entire **Zespół Szkół Prywatnych** community:
*   **Primary:** Students (ages 3-18), segmented into nursery, primary, and high school groups.
*   **Secondary:** Teachers, staff, and students' family members.

**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) measures included:**
*   **Universal Participation:** The event was free for all enrolled students.
*   **Differentiated Instruction:** Activities were tailored to various ages, languages (Polish/English), and learning styles.
*   **Inclusive Recognition:** All participants received certificates, not just competition winners.

## 🤝 Partnerships

We are grateful for the collaboration with our partner institutions, who provided in-kind support and expertise:

*   **University of Ghana (UG)**
